# Simple Shell Project

Welcome to the Simple Shell Project! This project is designed to challenge and enhance your skills in programming, C language, engineering thinking, group work, and independent learning. Please read this README carefully to ensure a successful and meaningful project experience.

## Learning Principles

- **Avoid Copying:** Do not copy code or solutions from others, including fellow students and online resources.
- **Independent Coding:** Write code independently from scratch after getting help to ensure your understanding.
- **No Sharing Solutions:** Refrain from sharing solutions with friends, as it doesn't help them or you.
- **No Resource Sharing:** Do not share or use resources that provide step-by-step solutions or videos.

## Project Approach

- **Framework and Whiteboarding:** Use the provided framework and focus on whiteboarding to plan your solutions.
- **Independent Learning:** Avoid looking at others' code or solutions. You possess the knowledge needed to complete the project.
- **Learning Process:** The goal is to learn how to approach the solution step by step, rather than seeking the final solution.

- **Collaboration:** Work collaboratively with your partner and ensure that both of you understand every line of code.
- **Communication:** If you can't actively contribute to the project, inform both the staff and your partner promptly.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll be able to:

- Gain a solid understanding of programming fundamentals.
