## Simple Shell


**Project Overview:**

The Simple Shell project is a fundamental component of our training at ALX SE. It involves creating a basic UNIX command interpreter or shell. This project is designed to assess our programming skills, particularly in C and UNIX systems.


**Project Requirements:**

- **Language:** C
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Code Style:** Follow the Betty style for coding.
- **Memory Management:** Ensure no memory leaks in the shell.
- **Functions:** No more than 5 functions per file.
- **Header Files:** All header files should be include guarded.
- **System Calls:** Use system calls only when necessary.
- **Documentation:** Create a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

**Project Guidelines:**

- **Coding:** well-documented code that passes the Betty checks.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handle errors, including end-of-file conditions (Ctrl+D).


**Project Phases:**

The project is divided into several phases, each building on the previous one. These include:

1. **Simple Shell 0.1:** Create a basic shell that can execute simple commands.

2. **Simple Shell 0.2:** Enhance the shell to handle command lines with arguments.

3. **Simple Shell 0.3:** Implement PATH handling and avoid unnecessary fork calls.

4. **Simple Shell 0.4:** Add the exit built-in command.

5. **Simple Shell 1.0:** Implement the env built-in command to display the current environment.

6. **Advanced Features:** Explore advanced features, including custom getline, handling aliases, variables, comments, and more.

**Testing:**
 cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid commands, arguments, and built-in commands.

**Conclusion:**

The Simple Shell project is a challenging yet exciting opportunity to hone our programming skills and deepen our understanding of UNIX systems. We are committed to following best practices, adhering to project guidelines, and producing a functional and efficient shell.

As we progress through the project, we will keep this README updated with our progress and any significant developments.
